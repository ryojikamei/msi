MSI: MicroSystemInstaller for Linux

I set this repository public, however, it may be far from being useful.

- steps: Installation steps. They can be run standalone.
- confs: Any settings to run installer. They should be set before invoking programs.
- stats: Current status of those programs. It is mainly used to pass the result to other programs. Individual programs should be run even if this directory is empty or illegal.
- utils: Utility programs
